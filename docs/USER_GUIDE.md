## Export tips
- The SVG includes red **50mm** and **100mm** calibration marks. Verify the printed size before cutting.
- The PDF output supports **A4 tiled (print at home)** and **A3 tiled (fewer pages)**.
- Print PDFs at **100% / Actual size** and disable “Fit to page” / “Scale to fit”.
- Measure the **50mm** and **100mm** marks with a ruler before cutting. Reprint if the scale is off.
- Each page shows an ID like **R1C1** plus a small **Assembly Map** to help assemble tiles.
- Use the **cut line** as the trimming guide, then align pages on the highlighted **GLUE LINE** overlap.
- Match the page ID and the stronger corner/edge registration marks before taping.
- For screen tracing, use **Calibrate screen** in the preview toolbar to match the **100mm** line to a ruler.

## Preview labels
- Use **Scale labels** to keep annotations readable while zooming.
- When scale is off, labels stay screen-sized while the geometry zooms/pans.
