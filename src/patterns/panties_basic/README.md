# Panties Basic Module

This module generates a simple front pattern piece for classic panties. The draft is intentionally minimal for the MVP and will be expanded with back pieces, optional gusset, and multi-style variants in future iterations.

## Notes
- Units are in centimeters.
- Seam allowance uses a simple offset curve and is intended as a visual guide.
- Draft assumes knit/stretch fabric with modest ease.
