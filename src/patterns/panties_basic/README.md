# Panties Basic Module

This module generates a multi-piece classic panties block with front, back, and gusset pieces (optional gusset lining).

## Notes
- Units are in centimeters.
- Front/back panels are drafted on the fold and include a foldline annotation.
- Gusset width defaults to 6cm (typical range 5–7cm) and can be adjusted via options.
- Seam allowance uses an offset curve and is intended as a visual guide.
- Draft assumes knit/stretch fabric with modest ease.
