# Panties Thong Basic Module

This module generates a thong pattern with separate front, back, and gusset pieces. The back panel narrows into a thong strap controlled by the thong width option.

## Notes
- Units are in centimeters.
- Front/back panels are drafted on the fold and include foldline annotations.
- Thong width controls the strap width at the narrowest point.
- Seam allowance uses an offset curve and is intended as a visual guide.
- Draft assumes knit/stretch fabric with modest ease.
